#Public Sanitation And Rating Review System

Inspiration: What it does?

Apps like uber, oyo rooms, etc use Google Maps APIs in their apps for location and navigation. By using existing and advanced features that Google has to offer they solve real world problems. In the similar manner and calling it as an inspiration if it is needed to, we used these APIs and built an android application for locating, profiling , reviewing and in turn improving overall quality of Public Sanitation System in India. The following are the major features that the app provide: 
Specific markers on map for locating toilets for male, female and physically disabled people.

Tells about the opening hours of sanitation facilities.
Navigation option to public toilets.
Hygiene, Infrastructure and safety star rating review.
Live Image upload while reviewing a toilet.
Feature to add new toilets that are not even available on Google Maps.
Administrator Control over these facilities. 
Check-In and check-out times for usage information.
Automated email to the in-charge of the toilet as soon as number of bad reviews crosses a certain limit.
Data Analysis of usage time and reviews of the toilets using graphs and charts.

Built With:

Django Framework ( Python ) for Server end.
Model View Presenter type Architecture for Android App development.
Git for Version control and simultaneous team work.
For Database we are using SQLite3
 Android Studio for android development
Google Map Api for location and navigation
Plotly library for plotting graphs and charts
